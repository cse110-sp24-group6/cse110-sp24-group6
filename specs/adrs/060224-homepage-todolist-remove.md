# Revamping Homepage Features - Removing To-Do list

## Context and Problem Statement

The homepage is the first page that a user lands own upon entry to the website. As such, it's important to showcase the main functions of the other sites (i.e. a visual summary of the other pages on the website). This allows users to quickly stay up to date and (limited) changes. However, we are unable to properly define a quick way to link the to-do list page to be displayed on the homepage as doing so at this point in time would likely lead to a decrease in quality (focusing on the iron triangle).

## Considered options

- Keep the to-do list display on the homepage
- Remove the to-do list display from the homepage

### Summary and Reasoning of Options


#### Keep To-Do List Display
**Advantages:**

- Ease of access for user to add/delete some tasks
- Quick preview on tasks to be done

**Disadvantages:**

- Difficult to implement as it relies on other web page
- Homepage may be a little too cluttered


#### Remove To-Do List Display
**Advantages:**

- Ensures better quality as scope of project is reduced
- Easier to design homepage given time constraints
- Less reliant on other web page

**Disadvantages:**

- Less 'ease of access' for user
- User will need to go to To-Do list portion of site to check their tasks

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Remove the to-do list display from the homepage

### Reason(s) for choice

We chose to remove the To-Do list display from the home page due to a few factors:

1. **Simplicity**: This will allow our homepage to feel less cluttered, giving more focus and/or attention to the projects on the homepage.
2. **Time**: Time is of the essence, and trying to implement a way to display some tasks from the To-Do list page may be too time consuming to get right and may reduce the quality of the overall product.
3. **Design**: This goes hand-in-hand with time; specifically, it will be less complex to design the homepage to make sure there is an actual welcome page for users.

Overall, removing the To-Do list display from the design of the homepage will provide for a better experience for the users (as it prioritizes quality) and better matches the current requirements.
