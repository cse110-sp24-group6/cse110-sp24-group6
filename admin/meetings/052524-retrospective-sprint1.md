## What will we try next? 
* Styling for pages
* Testing
* Documentation
* Spending more time organizing and planning

## What questions do we have? 
* Help needed in JS and CSS
* Does everyone have to make commits?

## Overall feedback 
### How happy were you with how we worked as a team?
  * Good work, more needs to be done on dividing work
  *  
### Did you feel you got a fair share of work? Do you want more things to do or feel like you got had a heavier workload than others?
  * Yes, uneven workload
  * We'll work more on this in our next sprint!
