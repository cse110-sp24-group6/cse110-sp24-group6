This part included working on the project. Working on different branches and merging everything to main was challenging- communication was key and our team did a great job on working together.

Everyone collorated on brainstorming and coming up with ideas for all aspects. Members were active on Slack and were present in our team meetings. All members were quick to give feedback and were active throughout. Great teamwork!
