## Overall feedback 
### How happy were you with how we worked as a team?
  * Generally positive responses
  * One mentioned "the team leads had too much responsibility"
### Did you feel you got a fair share of work? Do you want more things to do or feel like you got had a heavier workload than others?
  * Fair share, but could have contributed more 
### Any feedback for the leads?
  * Only positive feedback

Here are some other questions we discussed!

**How are you feeling right now?**

Anything that you were mad/annoyed about?
Anything that you were sad about?
Anything that you were glad about

Overall, everyone was satisfied with the work done so far, and while there is a lot of room for improvement, we have been functioning well as a team. No major issues so far!
