### Our Brainstorming Process

In order to get an idea of what we wanted our developer journal to be, we started off with a brainstorming session including all team members and diagrammed our ideas.

During this meeting, we planned out the features we were hoping to include in our project. In order to not include biases, as well as for more possible ideas outside of just us as developers, we created user personas and user stories to facilitate the brainstorming process as shown below:

> We made 4 different personas, each of varying age and wants in order to get more ideas

After creating these personas we went on to create a mindmap of the possible features we wanted to include and wrote down some ideas we had in mind for each.

</p>

> Category for each feature/functionality, more specific details in each branch

We also made a fat marker sketch to get a rough idea of how we wanted our project to look. While it was not exactly what we went with later on, it ultimately helped us understand how we wanted our application to function.

Following our initial brainstorming meeting, we then created a flow chart to demonstrate the general user flow of our application.

After finalizing our rough ideas and getting an idea for what to do, we made our [team pitch](specs/pitch/CSE_110_Team_6_Pitch.pdf) to show the TA.

### Agile Development Process

Our team followed the agile development process in order to iteratively create our product through consistent meetings and frequent project updates.

**Weekly Team Meetings**
* Our team met through Zoom every Saturday around 5pm in order to check-in and see everyone's progress. We also took that time to go over any ideas we had, as well as to plan out the next week's work.
* Towards the end of the quarter, we included a second short meeting after Thursday's class in order to have more time to discuss.

**Daily Standups**
* While not actually having daily standup meetings, we did implement a daily check-in system in our Slack server. We would post daily any work we did and what we planned on doing in order to have more communication among the team outside of our meetings.

**Branching Strategies**
* Our team wanted to minimize the number of branches we would have to make, as having an excessive amount would lead to dead/redundant branches. Similarly, having too few branches could lead to merge conflicts further down the line.
* We decided to create a branch for each feature we would be implementing as our major branches. From there, any tweaks that would have to be made were included in smaller branches in order to maintain cleanliness throughout the branches.

**Making it Offline**
* In order to implement offline functionality for our web application, we decided to use Service Workers.
* Considering our options for this, we chose to utilize the method that we had some experience with through the Labs.
